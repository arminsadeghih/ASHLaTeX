# ASHLaTeX
A thesis template for physics students at the University of Tehran<br>
When I started working on this file in my Master's, it had so many errors and bugs. I fixed them and optimized it. You can find the version details in the cls file. This is the 1.1 version. It may be updated in the future, but I wrote my PhD thesis using this template, and it should work fine.<br>
Each line in the files has a description, and if you want to change the files, read them carefully.<br>
Don't forget to install the wanted fonts.<br><br>
You can also download the .zip file from my webpage: [ASH LaTeX template](https://arminsadeghi.net/ASHLaTeX/ASH%20Thesis%20Template%201.1.zip),<br>

Enjoy!<br>
